# Business Analytics Capstone Project (BIA-500)

Problem Statement: Rising gun violence in The US and why it is increasingly associated with racial aspects

- With an upsurge in hate crimes related to race, mass killings have become more common in the US. A publicly accessible dataset will be used in this project's investigation of the characteristics of mass killing occurrences and their perpetrators.
- The results will throw light on the distribution, the weapons used, and the traits of offenders, victims, and mass murder instances in the US, particularly in relation to race. 
- The project will begin with data preparation and cleaning to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. Next, statistical testing, data visualization, and machine learning techniques will be used.
- The results demonstrate the value of data analysis and visualization techniques and may impact public policy or prevention efforts.
